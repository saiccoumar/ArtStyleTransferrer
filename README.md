# Style Transferer

Welcome to my CSP Project. This is an image to art converter application that capitalizes heavily on the magenta ML model but I might go back and make my own when I have a GPU. If you wanna run it, I didn't make a requirements.txt but just keep pip install-ing the stuff you need until the errors go away. No particularly odd imports were used so the most up to date version should work. From there just run app.py and then go to localhost:8000 and follow the GIF.
